I am a Ph.D student at UT Austin in the dept. of Aerospace Engineering. My interests are in the area of robotics, optimization, control, and systems engineering. For my Ph.D. work, I am advised by [Prof. Ryan Russell](http://sites.utexas.edu/russell/) in collaboration with Prof. [Patrick Wensing](https://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/) (at Uni. Notre Dame).
