I recently finished my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engg. from the University of Texas at Austin, and currently work as a <b>Locomotion Control Engineer</b> at [Shift Robotics](https://shiftrobotics.io/) in Austin TX. 

During my Ph.D, I worked on improving model-based control methods for planning & control of legged robots. Specifically, I developed analytical derivatives of Rigid-Body dynamics, which is used to model the non-linear physical model for legged motion. I was fortunate enough to publish in multiple IEEE conferences and journals including ICRA, IROS, Humanoids, RA-L and TR-O. For my Ph.D, I was advised jointly by [Dr. Ryan Russell](http://sites.utexas.edu/russell/) and [Dr. Patrick Wensing](https://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/) (at UND). During my Ph.D. program, I also interned at Flexiv Robotics (Santa Clara) working towards contact aware MPC based controllers for manipulators.

I also participate as a reviewer for multiple IEEE conferences & journals, along with Springer Multibody System Dynamics, and the International Journal of Humanoid Robots (IJHR).

In the past, I have worked on projects in the area of systems engineering for Mars mission architecture design, optimization for hypersonic mission design, and deep reinforcement learning for job scheduling algorithms.

Apart from work, I like to explore new food/culture and travel. I am also curious about the art of effective communication. I am a part of the [UT Sciences Toastmasters](https://utsciencestm.wixsite.com/website) where we practice public speaking and a peer mentor at the [LSI-Moody College of Communication](https://moody.utexas.edu/centers/lang-stuttering-institute).
