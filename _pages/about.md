I am a Ph.D student at UT Austin in the dept. of Aerospace Engineering. My research interests are mainly in the area of robotics, optimization, control, dynamic locotion and systems engineering. Currently I am working on designing efficient model based algorithms for legged robotics for use in a Differential Dynamic Programming based optimization method. For my Ph.D. work, I am advised by [Prof. Ryan Russell](http://sites.utexas.edu/russell/) in collaboration with Prof. [Patrick Wensing](https://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/) (at Uni. Notre Dame).

In the past, I have worked on projects in the area of systems engineering for Mars mission architecture design, deep reinforcement learning for job scheduling algorithms and optimization for hypersonic mission design.
