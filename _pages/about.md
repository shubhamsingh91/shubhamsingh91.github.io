I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin in the dept. of Aerospace Engineering. My research interests are mainly in the area of robotics, optimization, control, dynamic location, and systems engineering. Currently, I am working on designing efficient model-based algorithms for legged robotics for use in a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) based optimization method. For my Ph.D. work, I am advised by [Dr. Ryan Russell](http://sites.utexas.edu/russell/) and [Dr. Patrick Wensing](https://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/) (at Uni. Notre Dame). I completed my Master's degree in Aerospace Systems from Purdue University, where I was working in the [Systems-of-systems Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoSL), and [Rapid Design of Systems Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RDSL/) under Dr. Michael Grant. 

In the past, I have worked on projects in the area of systems engineering for Mars mission architecture design, optimization for hypersonic mission design, and deep reinforcement learning for job scheduling algorithms.

Apart from work, I like to explore new food/culture and travel. I am also curious about the art of effective communication. I am a part of the [UT Sciences Toastmasters](https://utsciencestm.wixsite.com/website) where we practice public speaking and a peer mentor at the [LSI-Moody College of Communication](https://moody.utexas.edu/centers/lang-stuttering-institute).
